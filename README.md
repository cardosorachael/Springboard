## About This Directory
This folder contains all submissions for Springboard's Data Engineering Track Capstone project and showcases skills learnt during the course to perform analysis on an existing dataset to derive meaningful answers. Each directory contains the scripts and/or supporting files needed for each submission. 
## Prerequisites 
Python 
Packages used: pandas, numpy 
## Subdirectories 
### Submission_1 
-  This folder contains the python scripts to process the raw data (downloaded .json files) into a more accessible format. 3 methods were initially explored to convert the .json files to .csv which is outlined in the "read_json_data_exploring_fastest_method.py" file.
-  The second script: "read_data_chunksize.py" was used to process the five datasets
-  The Processed_data folder contains subdirectories of each dataset type (business, user, review, tips and checkins) with the processed, smaller csv files 

### Data_Exploration
- This folder contains a jupyter notebook of the initial exploration into each table and the steps required to clean, normalize and further process data to make it more suitable for querying later on. 
- An image of the entity-relationship model is also present to better visualize the results of the data exploration
